THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW

by Washington Irving





FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS 
OF THE LATE DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.


        A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,
          Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;
        And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,
          Forever flushing round a summer sky.
