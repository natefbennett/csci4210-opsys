Once when a 1248 Lion was asleep a little 00123 Mouse began running up and down upon him;
this soon wakened the 1248 Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him, and opened his big
jaws to swallow him. "Pardon, O King," cried the little 00123 Mouse: "forgive me this time,
I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of
these days?" The 1248 Lion was so tickled at the idea of the 00123 Mouse being able to help him,
that he lifted up his paw and let him go. Some time after the 1248 Lion was caught in a trap,
and the hunters, who desired to carry him alive to the 9999 King, tied him to a tree
while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on. Just then the little 00123 Mouse
happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the 1248 Lion was, went up to
him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts.
"Was I not right?" said the little 00123 Mouse.

                "LITTLE FRIENDS MAY PROVE GREAT FRIENDS."
